# Apartment_rental_price_estimate
Project realised for the Statistical Learning exam of the Master in Data Science at the University of Trento.

I cleaned a scraped dataset containing features about rental apartments in the USA and fitted a prevision model to identify the apartment prices using K-fold cross validation and LASSO.
